Assignment 1

Pandas: Pandas is important python library for data analysis and data science
Important functions

.read_csv(): used to read csv file and store it into pandas dataframe

dataframe is a 2D datastructure with columns of different data types, similar to SQL table or spreadsheet

.head(n): it is used to return the first n rows of a dataset

.describe(): used to generate statistics of the dataset and gives central tendencies, etc

loc[:] : used to slice the dataset

data_1.loc[0:4, ['Name', 'Age', 'State']]
Output:

Name	Age	State
0	Alam	29	Madhya Pradesh
1	Rohit	23	Delhi
2	Bimla	35	Haryana
3	Rahul	25	West Bengal
4	Chaman	32	Tamil Nadu

df.iloc[0]          # Accessing a row by index
df.iloc[0:3]        # Accessing multiple rows by index range
df.loc[0, 'Name']   # Accessing a specific element by row index and column name

value_counts(): returns the number of occurences of a column

data_1['State'].value_counts()
Output:

Haryana           3
Delhi             2
West Bengal       1
Tamil Nadu        1
Bihar             1
Madhya Pradesh    1

.shape: returns the number of rows and columns 

.dtypes: returns the datatype of each column

.isnull(): returns true for missing values

df.isnull().sum(): return sum of no. of null values in each column

df.fillna(method='bfill', inplace=True): used to fill null values with next non-null column values

df.fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True): used to fill null values with previous non-null column values

inplace=True is an optional parameter that modifies the DataFrame in place, meaning it will directly modify the existing DataFrame rather than creating a new one. If inplace=False or omitted, the method will return a new DataFrame with the filled values.

df['sepal_length']=df['sepal_length'].astype(int) //converted float datatype into int
df.dtypes

The sklearn.preprocessing module from scikit-learn provides various functions for preprocessing data before applying machine learning algorithms. It offers several methods for scaling, transforming, encoding, and normalizing data.
from sklearn import preprocessing
le = preprocessing.LabelEncoder()
df['species']=le.fit_transform(df['species'])

df refers to the entire pandas DataFrame object. It represents the full dataset or table containing all rows and columns of data.

df.head() is a method in pandas DataFrame that returns the first few rows of the DataFrame. 

df.tail()

matplotlib: imp plotting library for plots and visualisations

outliers: outliers in a dateset refer to data points that significantly deviate from the majority of other data points. 

How to identify outliers?
Plotting the data can often reveal outliers visually. Box plots, scatter plots, or histograms can help identify data points that are far away from the bulk of the data.
Statistical techniques such as z-score or modified z-score can be used to identify outliers based on their deviation from the mean or median. Data points with z-scores above a certain threshold  can be considered outliers.

Standard Deviation: it tells how much the values will deviate from the mean

z = (x - μ) / σ

z is the z-score.
x is the individual data point.
μ is the mean of the distribution.
σ is the standard deviation of the distribution.

The z-score tells you how many standard deviations a data point is above or below the mean. A positive z-score indicates that the data point is above the mean, while a negative z-score indicates that the data point is below the mean.

A histogram represents the distribution of data by dividing it into intervals (bins) along the x-axis and displaying the frequency or count of data points falling into each bin on the y-axis.


A histogram is a graph showing frequency distributions.

It is a graph showing the number of observations within each given interval.
